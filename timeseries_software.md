Statsmodels: statistical modeling and econometrics in Python 

* [PyFlux (Python包 未开发完全 提供了使用文档readdocs)](https://github.com/RJT1990/pyflux)

PyFlux is an open source time series library for Python. The library has a good array of modern time series models, as well as a flexible array of inference options (frequentist and Bayesian) that can be applied to these models. By combining breadth of models with breadth of inference, PyFlux allows for a probabilistic approach to time series modelling.

See some examples and documentation below. PyFlux is still only alpha software; this means you use it at your own risk, that test coverage is still in need of expansion, and also that some modules are still in need of being optimized.
